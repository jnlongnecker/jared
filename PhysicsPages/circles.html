            Click on the canvas to bounce the circles away from the mouse point. Bounced circles will 
            make a "pop" sound and change to a randomized color. Every 3rd "pop" makes confetti appear.

        <h1>About This Project</h1>
        <p class = "info">
            This was the very first of all my projects on this site, so a lot of the process was simply learning the new technology
            of the p5.js library. First, let's discuss how it works: There are 16 circles that get created when the window is loaded.
            Each circle has a randomized position and radius, and to ensure circles do not get created within each other, each circle
            is repositioned if it is inside another circle. This process repeats until no circles intersect. Circles are assigned a
            mass based on their radius and an initial, random force is applied to each circle. On a collision, circles will bounce
            according to where they impacted the other surface.
        </p>

        <p class = "info">
            This project went through several iterations where it began with no forces, added forces and then removed them again. I
            did end up keeping the initalizing force to create velocities that correspond as expected to the size of the circles, but
            that's it. The primary issue this project went through was how to get a convincing reflection on a bounce. When I 
            finally got a convincing equation, collisions on an object from behind ended up looking nonsensical, so there needed to 
            be an additional check and handling of all collisions from behind.
        </p>
        <p class = "info">
            The collision normal that velocity is reflected over is actually quite simple, it's the difference of the two circles'
            centers. When colliding from behind, the velocity heading is averaged with the collision heading to get the new heading. 
            In order to ensure that circles do not speed up to hilariously impossible speed, the magnitude of all velocities is
            kept constant.
