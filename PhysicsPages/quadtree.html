        <h1>About This Project</h1>
        <p class="info">
            In creating the Circles project, it was immediately obvious that the way collision was being checked was
            inefficient.
            The original check needed to compare every circle against every other circle, with a slight optimization
            being that
            you only need to check against the circles that haven't already checked against every other circle. And yeah
            that's all
            great, but clearly this can be optimized. Enter: The QuadTree.

        <p class="info">
            A QuadTree is a data structure that divides a rectangular space into 4 subspaces (hence "Quad") and each of
            these
            subspaces tracks the entities within it. Whenever one of these Quads becomes "full", which is some somewhat
            arbitrary
            capacity, the Quad will divide itself into 4 more Quads. This makes accessing entities within a desired
            space an
            easy task, and results in checking against significantly fewer entities.
        </p>
        <p class="info">
            Most of the work for this project was moreso in the detection of whether certain shapes intersected rather
            than the
            actual tree itself. The simplest implementation of the tree only detects individual points. As we can
            clearly see,
            most thing in the real world occupies more space than a single point, so it's fairly important to be able to
            tell
            when an object is partially included in a space. While this has little to do with the QuadTree as a data
            structure,
            it is important for the practical application of it.
