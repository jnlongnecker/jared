        <h1>What Is This Place?</h1>
        <p class="info">
            This is my personal playground, a place for me to be creative and share my journey of CSS, HTML and
            Javascript
            as
            I work on
            projects that interest me. Everything that you see on this site will be 100% written in HTML, CSS and base
            Javascript with the p5 JS library. It will
            also all be written by me, meaning no fancy libraries other than p5.
        </p>
        <hr class="main-hr" />
        <p class="info">
            My projects will be using the p5 canvas, so each project will be on its own page. The
            <a href="PhysicsPages/circles.html">bouncing circles above</a> are an example of
            one of these projects. Each project will come alongside a blurb detailing how I created it, the struggles
            that I
            had and what
            you can do with it, if it is interactable.

            This site is developed and intented for desktop use, but does support mobile viewing. If something seems...
            off
            on
            mobile
            that's probably the best I could get it.

        <h1>Who Are You?</h1>
        <p class="info">
            I'm so glad you asked, my name is Jared Longnecker. In my day-to-day, I'm a Salesforce Developer; exciting I
            know. I have a BS in Computer Science from the University of Houston and, as you may imagine from this page,
            I
            have a great interest in graphics, visualization and programming. These interests take me between the
            science
            trifecta of theoretical mathematics, physics, and algorithms.

            All that to say I am NOT a professional web designer, so if you don't like the design well that's not really
            what
            this is all
            about now is it? If you do like the design though, then thank you very much. Like I mentioned before, this
            uses
            nothing but
            my own hand written code; so no CSS libraries either. It's meant as a learning tool as much as a portfolio
            of my
            interests.
        </p>
        <p class="info">
            I hope at the end of the day you enjoy what you see here and perhaps learn something along the way. Enjoy
            your
            stay!
