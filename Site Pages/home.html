        <h1>What Is This Place?</h1>
        <p class="info">
            This is my personal playground, a place for me to be creative and share my journey of CSS, HTML and
            Javascript as I work on projects that interest me. Everything that you see on this site will be 100% written
            in HTML, CSS and base Javascript with the p5 JS library. It will also all be written by me, meaning no fancy
            libraries other than p5.
        </p>
        <hr class="main-hr" />
        <p class="info">
            My projects will be using the p5 canvas in order to visualize the simulation. The
            <a href="PhysicsPages/circles.html">bouncing circles above</a> are an example of
            one of these projects. Each project will come alongside a blurb detailing how I created it, the struggles
            that I had and what you can do with it, if it is interactable.
        </p>
        <p class="info">
            This site is developed and intented for desktop use, but does support mobile viewing. Since a lot of these
            p5 projects can be expensive in processing, any notable projects that are not optimized well enough for
            convenient mobile viewing will be noted.

        <h1>Who Are You?</h1>
        <p class="info">
            I'm so glad you asked, my name is Jared Longnecker. In my day-to-day, I'm a Salesforce Developer with my
            Salesforce Administrator I certification. I have a BS in Computer Science from the University of Houston
            and, as you may imagine from this page, I have a great interest in graphics, visualization and programming.
            These interests take me between the science trifecta of theoretical mathematics, physics, and algorithms.

            While the design of this page is not the primary focus of it, it's still important to look good right? Like
            I mentioned before, this uses nothing but my own hand written code; so no CSS libraries either. It's meant
            as a learning tool as much as a portfolio of my interests.
        </p>
        <p class="info">
            I hope at the end of the day you enjoy what you see here and perhaps learn something along the way. Enjoy
            your stay!
