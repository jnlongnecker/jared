    <h1>What Is This Place?</h1>
    <p class = "info">
      This is my personal playground, a place for me to be creative and share my journey of CSS, HTML and Javascript as I work on
      projects that interest me. Everything that you see on this site will be 100% written in HTML, CSS and base Javascript with the p5 JS library. It will
      also all be written by me, meaning no fancy libraries other than p5.
    </p>
    <hr class = "main-hr" />
    <p class = "info">
      My projects will be using the p5 canvas, so each project will be on its own page. The bouncing circles above are an example of
      one of these projects. Each project will come alongside a blurb detailing how I created it, the struggles that I had and what
      you can do with it, if it is interactable.
    </p>
    <p class = "info">
      This site is developed and intented for desktop use, but does support mobile viewing. If something seems... off on mobile
      that's probably the best I could get it.

    <h1>Who Are You?</h1>
    <p class = "info">
      I'm so glad you asked, my name is Jared Longnecker. In my day-to-day, I'm a Salesforce Developer; exciting I know. I have
      a BS in Computer Science from the University of Houston and, as you may imagine from this page, I have a great interest in
      graphics, visualization and programming. These interests take me between the science trifecta of theoretical mathematics, 
      physics, and algorithms.

    <p class = "info">
      All that to say I am NOT a professional web designer, so if you don't like the design well that's not really what this is all
      about now is it? If you do like the design though, then thank you very much. Like I mentioned before, this uses nothing but
      my own hand written code; so no CSS libraries either. It's meant as a learning tool as much as a portfolio of my interests.
    </p>
    <p class = "info">
      I hope at the end of the day you enjoy what you see here and perhaps learn something along the way. Enjoy your stay!
