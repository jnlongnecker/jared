                    One of the many things I am interested in are video games. My whole life, I've loved these
                    interactive programs and dreamed of creating my own for a long time. In fact, my love for video
                    games inspired my passion for programming. In my interest, one day I found myself watching a video
                    on random content generation for video games, and the Wave Function Collapse algorithmic technique
                    was put on full display.

                    Here's how the algorithm works:
                <ol>
                    <li>Cut up the input into patterns depending on the sampling size N
                    <li>Rotate the patterns across specified degrees of symmetry to create more patterns
                    <li>Create an output of patterns, starting with every pattern at every position at the same time
                    <li>Pick the position closest to be solved and randomly pick a pattern for it to be
                    <li>Based on that chosen pattern, adjacent patterns may no longer fit, so remove those from the
                        possibility pool and repeat until no patterns can be removed
                    <li>Repeat 4-5 until each position has 1 pattern or if a position has 0 patterns and fails
                </ol>
                </p>
                <p class="info">
                    The process of writing this was fairly straightforward, but took quite a bit of effort in
                    understanding the implementation. The original algorithm
                    (found <a href="https://github.com/mxgmn/WaveFunctionCollapse">here</a>) was not exactly written
                    in a way that was intended to be read. Lots of single letter variables and no comments. Luckily
                    for me, it was written in a language I am familiar with (C#) and so I went adding my own comments
                    for better understanding how it works (if you're interested in this deconstruction, you can find my
                    fork <a href="https://github.com/jnlongnecker/WaveFunctionCollapse">here</a>).

                <p class="info">
                    Once the deconstruction of the algorithm was done and I sufficiently understood it, I then underwent
                    the task of translating the algorithm to JavaScript. How the algorithm works here is that the
                    pattern I supply to the algorithm is created by the user in the canvas, which is stored as a matrix
                    of colors. The algorithm then runs and outputs a larger matrix of colors based on the supplied
                    pattern.
