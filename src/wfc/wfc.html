                    One of the many things I am interested in are video games. My whole life, I've loved these
                    interactive programs and dreamed of creating my own for a long time. In fact, my love for video
                    games inspired my passion for programming. In my interest, one day I found myself watching a video
                    on random content generation for video games, and the Wave Function Collapse algorithmic technique
                    was put on full display.

                <p class="info">
                    Here's how the algorithm works:
                <ol>
                    <li>Cut up the input into patterns depending on the sampling size N
                    <li>Rotate the patterns across specified degrees of symmetry to create more patterns
                    <li>Create an output of patterns, starting with every pattern at every position at the same time
                    <li>Pick the position closest to be solved and randomly pick a pattern for it to be
                    <li>Based on that chosen pattern, adjacent patterns may no longer fit, so remove those from the
                        possibility pool and repeat until no patterns can be removed
                    <li>Repeat 4-5 until each position has 1 pattern or if a position has 0 patterns and fails
                </ol>
                </p>
                <p class="info">
                    The process of writing this was fairly straightforward, but took quite a bit of effort in
                    understanding the implementation. The original algorithm
                    (found <a href="https://github.com/mxgmn/WaveFunctionCollapse">here</a>) was not exactly written
                    in a way that was intended to be read. Lots of single letter variables and no comments. Luckily
                    for me, it was written in a language I am familiar with (C#) and so I went adding my own comments
                    for better understanding how it works (if you're interested in this deconstruction, you can find my
                    fork <a href="https://github.com/jnlongnecker/WaveFunctionCollapse">here</a>).

                <hr />
                <p class="info">
                    Once the deconstruction of the algorithm was done and I sufficiently understood it, I then underwent
                    the task of translating the algorithm to JavaScript. How the algorithm works here is that the
                    pattern I supply to the algorithm is created by the user in the canvas, which is stored as a matrix
                    of colors. The algorithm then runs and outputs a larger matrix of colors based on the supplied
                    pattern.

                    Then came the task of the visualization. Recreating the algorithm itself took a fairly long time,
                    but was more or less a solved task. How to visualize the algorithm in progress, and most importantly
                    of all, display that progress to the user efficiently was quite a difficult task. How it works is
                    like this:
                <ol>
                    <li>Run a few passes of observations and propogations of the observations
                    <li>Calculate a new pattern based on the remaining patterns at a given position
                        <ul>
                            <li>This pattern is an average of all the other patterns' colors
                        </ul>
                    <li>Send this along as output to be displayed
                </ol>
                </p>
                <p class="info">
                    The first implementation of this was slow, dreadfully so. The calculation of the in-progress pattern
                    was simply too time consuming at the higher degrees of symmetry because of the large number of
                    patterns. Some optimizations were made to only calculate positions that had changed since the last
                    in-progress calculation, but this still was not enough.
                </p>
                <p class="info">
                    The solution to this is multi-threading
                    using JavaScript workers, which is something I had never touched before or even knew was possible.
                    Since the Wave Function Collapse object running the calculation needed a reference to p5 for some
                    things in my implementation, this became another problem to be solved as p5 protects itself from
                    being copied and sent to a different thread. In the end, I had to recreate the p5 functions I was
                    using myself.
